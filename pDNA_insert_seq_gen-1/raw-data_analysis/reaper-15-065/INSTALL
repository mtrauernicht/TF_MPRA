Change directory to 'src', then type 'make':

   cd src
   make

This should create four binaries, namely

   reaper   (read trimming, filtering, demultiplexing)
   tally    (deduplication of reads, re-pairing independently paired end reads)
   minion   (adapter inference from sequence files)
   swan     (simple local alignments)

Copy them to a place in your $PATH, or execute them by using a fully
qualified path.
